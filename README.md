# [Migrate an Android App to Material Design][published url]
## Instructor: [Ashraff Hathibelagal][instructor url]


Years ago, when Android was still a budding mobile operating system, it was rather notorious for its ugly user interface. Because there were no design guidelines to follow back then, Android apps weren't pretty either. By introducing Material Design, Google has revolutionized Android user interfaces. Apps created from scratch today using Android Studio automatically follow Material Design's guidelines. However, there are many of us who still have apps that were built before Material Design. Applying Material Design guidelines to them is not straight-forward.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Ashraff Hathibelagal will show you how to migrate an old-fashioned app to Material Design. You'll learn how to use the themes, widgets, and gestures available in the Android Support libraries to convert an app that was built for Android Gingerbread into a modern app whose look and feel matches that of Android Lollipop and Marshmallow.
